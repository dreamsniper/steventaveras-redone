                <p>This session we learned how to create a component in Fusion and bring in seperate components from other files into our drawing. Then Hinging them together to create movable parts. We were also tasked to begin creating our prototypes in the fusion Program to then have it laser cut.</p>

                <h5>September 17th-19th 2019</h5>
                <p>This week in class we began to learn how to use Fusion 360. Fusion 360 is an integrated CAD, CAM, and CAE software. It is similar to Googles Sketchup and Autocad.</p>
                <p>Its a surprisingly easy program to learn as long as you have an idea of what you are creating. This week we designed the egg that would be used in our project using the measurements we took during our visit to the workshop. in the first week.</p>

                <h5>September 10th-14th 2019</h5>
                <p>The day before this class I was busy trying to put the design that I had in my mind together with the cardboard that was available. I had tried to do something like a box protected with globe like rings but hated it after the first prototype. This is what i came up with after.</p>
                <p>I wanted the piece to protect the egg but also wanted it to look artistic. My design started to look like something that came from out of the sea.</p>

                <h5>September 3rd-5th 2019</h5>
                <p>During This week, we were asked to continue to build the ideas for our Egg Drop Project using the materials from class.I had originally thought to create a circular globe like vehicle with various attachments that would protect the egg like flying Butresses.</p>
                <p>After initially creating a mochup of the globe design i decided to scrap it and go back to the drawing board. I realized that i was unhappy with so many moving pieves and wanted something a little more solid.</p>
                <p>Thats when i began to create the design that would eventually lead to my final piece.</p>

                <p>During the first week we met our professor Tak Cheung, He is a highly skilled product designer and educator in New York City. </p>
                <p>We Learned about our Project for the first half of the semester. It was an Egg Drop Project. We are to design a vehicle using 1/8in thick corrugated cardboard. Then we are supposed to take our prototype and design it using Fusion 360, a 3d program similar to Google Sketchup.</p>
                <p>We quickly went to work soon after in the shop studio learning how the material we were using worked. We also started taking measurements of our eggs in order to have realistic models when we begin to use Fusion.</p>
