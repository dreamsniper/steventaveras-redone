My updated website

## New Look

The site now feels more like a landing page with various sections.

It's more fluid and simple. A lot cleaner and elegant.

The distracting background images have been removed.

I went for a simpler color scheme.

The images have been replaced with simpler icons to strengthen the message.

The message has been more clarified.
